##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I placed all global and body style to base. I included all nested elements in body to layouts. I placed the finer, more specific styles to modules.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

Not really. Just moved them into their appropriate files and deleted the extra curly bracket from the styles.css.
